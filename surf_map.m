%% 3-D Surface Map for CSV data
% A brief introduction to loading and displaying a multivariate dataset
% loaded from a 3 column comma-seperated values file (.csv).
%
% This example was generated and written in MATLAB R2016b, and has not been
% tested in any other version.

%% Loading the CSV file
% The function |csvread()| is an inbuilt function that will read the
% numeric rows of a CSV file into a column matrix. Note that it cannot read
% text entries, and will fail, so you should specify the row that the
% numeric data starts. In the example data, this is the second row (indexed
% at 1), e.g.
%
%  0 firstPhaseRestarts,firstPhaseTime,result
%  1 1,1,29.65739688
%  2 1,2,30.30167637
%  .
%  .
%  .
%
rstart = 1; % Starting row = 1
dat    = csvread('example_data.csv',rstart);
%% Reshape the data
% For coordinate (or equivalent) data, such that the first and second rows
% of the _dat_ represent independent variables, subsequently referenced as
% _x_ ( |X| ) and _y_ ( |Y| ) respectively, a rectilinear coordinate space
% is assumed, and there a vector of unique _x_ and _y_ values 
% $|x|\times|y| = |dat|$ as indicated by the following |assert|.
nx = length(unique(dat(:,1)));
ny = length(unique(dat(:,2)));

assert(nx*ny == length(dat));
%%
% In a rectilinear grid, it is then possible to sort the data, first by _x_
% and then by _y_, which allows for easy reshaping of _dat_ into a set of 
% matrices of size $|x|\times|y|$. Shaping the dependent variable (assumed
% to be the values in the 3rd column) in this form allows for a matrix
% based surface representation.
dat = sortrows(dat,[1 2]); % Sort dat rows by 1st column then by 2nd

X = reshape(dat(:,1),[nx ny]);
Y = reshape(dat(:,2),[nx ny]);
Z = reshape(dat(:,3),[nx ny]);
%% Creating the plot
% It is quite simple now to represent the data as a 3D plot, using the
% <matlab:doc('surf') surf> function. Variable _h_ represents the handle to
% the surf, used later for styling

h = surf(X,Y,Z);
%% Styling the plot
% It's clear from the plot that the axis scale should be logarithmed, so
% it's desirable to adjust the axis scaling. To edit the axes, the
% properties can be editted programatically, or through the Property Editor
% in the Figure window, via |Tools > Edit Plot|.
% 
% A list of Axes properties is available
% <matlab:web(fullfile(docroot,'matlab/ref/axes-properties.html')) here>.

g = gca; % 'gca' returns the handle for the current Axes Object

g.XScale = 'log';
g.YScale = 'log';
%%
% To change scaling and view of the axes, there are various controls. For
% example, it is often desirable to set the axes limits to show the limits
% of the data. Programmatically setting the view direction of the plot,
% especially in the case of 3-D plots, can be helpful in manually creating
% multiple plots that are viewed from the same angle. It is possible to
% manually shape the view using the |Rotate 3D| Tool in the Figure window,
% and gain azimuthal and elevation angles of the camera: |[az,el] = view;|
% These can be used to then set the |view| dynamically.

view(-20,50); % view(az,el);
%%
% Choosing a colour map is important in highlighting the features of a
% plot. It is easy to set the colour map using any preset map (defined in
% <matlab:doc(colormap) colormap>) or by manually creating a |3xN| column
% matrix of RGB values (scaled 0-1). To add the colour bar to the plot,
% simply add the |colorbar| line.
%
% To change the nature of the shading, such that face colour is smooth,
% rather than flat, the face colour should be set to be interpolated.
% Setting |h.EdgeColor| to |'none'| will prevent edges being displayed.

colormap winter % Set colour map
colorbar        % Show colour bar

h.FaceColor = 'interp';
h.EdgeColor = 'none';

%%
% In some circumstances, transparency makes for pretty plotting. However
% sometimes this doesn't translate well onto paper (literally). Use with
% discretion.
%
% FaceAlpha describes the 'alpha channel' of each face on the surface
% (i.e. opacity, 0 = invisible, 1 = fully opaque). This needs to be
% interpolated when |FaceColor| is set to |'interp'|. The function
% |alpha()| sets the alpha value per _Z_ coordinate (so needs to be a
% matrix of |size(Z)|
h.FaceAlpha = 'interp';

alpha(h,Z); % depth-scaled opacity

% Alternatively (for constant 50\% opacity):
%    alpha(h,0.5*ones(size(Z));

%% Save me
% To save the figure programmatically use <matlab:doc(saveas) saveas>).
% Alternatively, use the Figure window (|File > Save As...|).
f = gcf; % 'gcf' returns the handle for the current Figure Object

saveas(f,'example_surface.png') % save the current Figure as '.png'
saveas(f,'example_surface.eps') % save the current Figure as '.eps'
