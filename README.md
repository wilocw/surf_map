# SURF_MAP

A brief introduction to loading and displaying a multivariate dataset loaded
from a 3 column comma-seperated values file (.csv).

This example code was generated and written in MATLAB R2016b, and has not been
tested in any earlier version.

## Usage

This repository contains an classic MATLAB script `surf_map.m`, as well as a 
live script `surf_map.mlx`. The tutorial can be viewed in PDF or HTML format, 
`doc.pdf` and `doc.html` respectively, or within MATLAB by running `run_for_help`
or `showdemo('surf_map')` in the Command Window.
